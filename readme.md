# Note
This repository is created on top of [MemorizationGame](https://github.com/lu6644/memorizationGame), which was a teamwork of Menghua Jiang, me, Yiqing Wu and Wanqin Jiang. Thank every teammate for contribution. I wish to keep the original repository as it is while performing some changes to this projects. I plan to do the following in this new repository for improvements:
- Introduce Realtional Database and ultilize RoomDB as abstraction
- Refine the UI implementation
- Use Layered and MVVM architecture
- Improve authentication
